##BINARY COCKTAIL
###A useless equation only the inane would like to know

Let me tell a story.

Once upon a time there was a young man who was bored at work.  He worked at a bookstore.  Day in and day out he enjoyed reading, helping customers, writing orders, shelving, sweeping, and managing the bookstore.  But sometimes he could get bored.  This happened especially on rainy days, when customers were scarce and a silence seemed to emanate beautifully and oppressively from the books themselves. 

This young man, bored but not forgetting his "inner resources," picked up a book nearest to him, which happened to be a math text.  He opened to a page, which happened to be about the binary number system.  He read.  He did some equations in his head.  He figured out that the binary equivalent of 12 is 1100. Of course he equated the binary of the number 42. 

He started listing binary numbers out: 0, 1, 01, 11, 001, 011, 111 . . .; as he did he thought he saw a pattern.  He wondered: what is the relationship between the zeros and the ones, in the range between the next value added (0 to 1, 01 to 11, 001 to 111) based on multiples of two? For 2 to the zero power, there's 0 and there's 1.  For 2 to the first, there's one 0 and three 1's.  To the fifth, from 000001 to 111111 (he wrote out each number vigorous and vigorously counted), there's eighty 0's, and one hundred and twelve 1's.  And for 10?  Too high to count.

There must be an equation, the young man said out loud to an empty bookstore. 

Thus he worked on that rainy afternoon to come up with the equation, to solve the absolutely useless problem of how many 0's and 1's would be in a given range of two to the nth power.  Thus became *binary cocktail*, an equation only useful at cocktail parties, and an application made for just such an occasion.
